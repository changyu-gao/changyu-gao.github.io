I am a second-year Industrial Engineering PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Stephen Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/).

Before Madison, I received my B.S. in mathematics at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

My current research interests are Bayesian learning, non-convex optimization and deep learning theory.
